This project uses Jquery to get data from the GIPHY API.  Users are able to search for GIFs by putting in a phrase or search word.

All user must do is select a key word or phrase and click on the submit button.  Once the button has been submitted 30 GIFs will populate based on the search results.

For this project I uses the folloing technologies:

.html
.css
.js
Jquery
Sass
GIPHY API

For future improvement I will do the following:

1. Update the site to allow the user to be able to enter in a different search result after

2. Link this page to a a dfferent set of pages that will allow a better use website

3. Make use of different colors of the page.
